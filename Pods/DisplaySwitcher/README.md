##Requirements
- iOS 9.0+
- Xcode 7
- Swift 2

##Installing with [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

```ruby
use_frameworks!
pod ‘DisplaySwitcher’, '~> 0.1.0'
```

##Usage

At first, import DisplaySwitcher:
```swift
import DisplaySwitcher
```

Then create two layouts (layout for list mode and grid mode):
```swift
private lazy var listLayout = BaseLayout(staticCellHeight: listLayoutStaticCellHeight, nextLayoutStaticCellHeight: gridLayoutStaticCellHeight, layoutState: .ListLayoutState)

private lazy var gridLayout = BaseLayout(staticCellHeight: gridLayoutStaticCellHeight, nextLayoutStaticCellHeight: listLayoutStaticCellHeight, layoutState: .GridLayoutState)
```

Set current layout:
```swift
private var layoutState: CollectionViewLayoutState = .ListLayoutState
collectionView.collectionViewLayout = listLayout
```

Then override two UICollectionViewDataSource methods:
```swift
func collectionView(collectionView: UICollectionView, numberOfItemsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
    // count of items
}

func collectionView(collectionView: UICollectionView, cellForItemAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -> UICollectionViewCell {
    // configure your custom cell
}
```

Also override one UICollectionViewDelegate method (for custom layout transition):
```swift
func collectionView(collectionView: UICollectionView, transitionLayoutForOldLayout fromLayout: UICollectionViewLayout, newLayout toLayout: UICollectionViewLayout) -> UICollectionViewTransitionLayout {
    let customTransitionLayout = TransitionLayout(currentLayout: fromLayout, nextLayout: toLayout)
    return customTransitionLayout
}
```
And in the end necessary create transition and start it:
```swift
let transitionManager: TransitionManager
if layoutState == .ListLayoutState {
    layoutState = .GridLayoutState
    transitionManager = TransitionManager(duration: animationDuration, collectionView: collectionView!, destinationLayout: gridLayout, layoutState: layoutState)
} else {
    layoutState = .ListLayoutState
    transitionManager = TransitionManager(duration: animationDuration, collectionView: collectionView!, destinationLayout: listLayout, layoutState: layoutState)
}
transitionManager.startInteractiveTransition()
```

Have fun! :)

#### Let us know!

We’d be really happy if you sent us links to your projects where you use our component. Just send an email to github@yalantis.com And do let us know if you have any questions or suggestion regarding the animation. 

P.S. We’re going to publish more awesomeness wrapped in code and a tutorial on how to make UI for iOS (Android) better than better. Stay tuned!
